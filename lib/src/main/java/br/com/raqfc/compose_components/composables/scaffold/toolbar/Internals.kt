/**
 * HACK: Compose tracks velocity with a local coordinate system which leads to an undesired
 * scroll experience. To mitigate this issue, we use RelativeVelocityTracker which tracks velocity
 * with a global coordinate system. In NestedScrollConnection, onPreScroll() gives us a delta
 * based on a global coordinate, we can use this value to properly calculate the velocity.
 *
 * The fundamental goal of this class is to override the Compose-calculated scroll velocity to
 * our manually calculated one.
